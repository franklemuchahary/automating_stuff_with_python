### Voice to Word Definition from https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/

While preparing for the GRE, I found myself using https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/ quite a lot to learn the definitions, synonyms and sample usage of various words. The only issue was, it did not have a `voice search` feature and I had to keep typing up the words. Hence, I wrote a small script that uses the library `speech_recognition` to listen and convert my speech to word and fetch the meaning from vocabulary.com. I have also fetched the audio file with the correct pronunciation of the word in addition to the definition.
